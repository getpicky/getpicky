*So you’re curious about the gluten-free diet.* You’ve seen gluten-free listed on menus at your favorite restaurants and on boxes of processed "health" foods at the market. Perhaps you've read about a celebrity going gluten-free while touting numerous health and wellness benefits. Let's face it, the gluten-free diet is becoming insanely popular.


I’ve learned a few things over the past 5 years of being 100% gluten-free. I’ve written this guide based on my own experience and struggles to help you kickstart your transition. I’m not a medical professional (just a passionate [culinary enthusiast](http://www.saveur.com/stop-saying-foodie)) so please talk to your doctor before self-diagnosis or embarking on an unnecessary restrictive diet.


__So, why are you going gluten-free?__ If it’s to lose weight, I should tell you right now that you will need to shift your priorities. The purpose of eliminating gluten from your diet is about getting  on track to feel your best. After going gluten-free many people have told me the change has given them an immense amount of energy and mental clarity. If you have an auto-immune disorder like Celiac, which requires a life-long and very strict gluten-free diet, I can tell you from my own experience that going gluten-free has completely changed my life for the better.


__What are the symptoms?__ Symptoms of a [*gluten allergy*](https://celiac.org/celiac-disease/non-celiac-gluten-sensitivity/) may include bloating, diarrhea, abdominal pain, tiredness, and skin rashes. Symptoms of *Celiac disease* may include all of the above _and_ fatigue, low blood count (anemia), gastrointestinal pain, malnutrition, amenorrhea, skin rash and osteoporosis. Take a moment to go through this [checklist](https://celiac.org/celiac-disease/symptomssigns/checklist/) provided by the Celiac Disease Foundation. (sources: mayoclinic.org & celiac.org)


__What is gluten?__ It's a mixture of proteins found in wheat, rye, and barley (and many other grains). Gluten nourishes plant embryos during germination <sup>[[1]](http://www.livescience.com/39726-what-is-gluten.html)</sup> and later helps food maintain its elastic shape, acting as a glue that gives dough a chewy texture.


__Is gluten evil?__ The short answer is no. "Wheat provides about twenty per cent of the world’s calories and more nourishment than any other source of food." <sup>[[2]](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/11/03/grain)</sup> But, the Western diet has changed drastically over the past century, and our genes have not. The incidents of celiac disease and gluten sensitivity has increased exponentially. Some researchers attribute these incidents to the changes in farming and mass-production while other studies show the grain has remained relatively similar over the past 50 years.


__So what can I eat?__ You can find many lists on the internet describing what you can and cannot eat while on a gluten-free diet. These lists may be overwhelming at first. Especially because some lists contradict one another. If you stick to the basics: fruits, vegetables, meats, seafood, dairy, beans, nuts and legumes (which are naturally gluten free) and avoid the super processed packaged GF foods, then you can gradually move into preparing more elaborate meals.


> __Grains allowed:__ Rice, Corn (Maize), Soy, Potato, Tapioca, Beans, Garfava, Sorghum, Quinoa, Millet, Buckwheat, Arrowroot, Amaranth, Teff, Montina, Flax and Nut Flours.
Grains not allowed in any form: Wheat (Einkorn, Durum, Faro, Graham, Kamut, Semolina, Spelt), Rye, Barley and Triticale.
>
> __Foods/products that may contain gluten:__ Beers, Ales, Lager, Breading & Coating Mixes, Brown Rice Syrup, Communion Wafers, Croutons, Dressings, Drugs & Over-the-Counter Medications, Energy Bars, Flour & Cereal Products, Herbal Supplements, Imitation Bacon, Imitation Seafood, Marinades, Nutritional Supplements, Pastas, Processed Luncheon Meats, Sauces & Gravies, Self-basting Poultry, Soy Sauce or Soy Sauce Solids, Soup Bases, Stuffings, Dressings, Thickeners (Roux), Vitamins & Mineral Supplements

__A note about dining out:__ Dining out can be very tedious so I suggest preparing meals yourself for the first 2 weeks. That way you can be sure there will be no contamination in your diet and you can really start to feel the positive effects of your changes. After 2 weeks, do some research to find a restaurant that will accommodate your dietary restriction. More on that below.

### Your essential gluten-free guide in 8 steps  
<br/>

1. Talk to your friends and family about your change. Initial conversations may go like this... “I should let you know that from now on I will be on a gluten-free diet. When we eat together you may notice that I will not consume certain items like breads, pastas, or sauces. Thanks for your support and understanding.” This conversation will inevitably lead to many questions about your symptoms. Be prepared with answers so you're not caught off-gaurd talking about delicate gastrointestinal issues.  Also, if you live with gluten lovers, kindly let them know they are _not required_ to go gluten-free and that you will store gluten-free items in separate cupboards and areas in the fridge to avoid cross-contamination. This goes for cooking surfaces and pans too.


2. It’s time to clean out your kitchen. You will need to become a label inspector. Every single package of food and supplement (like multi-vitamins) will need to be closely examined and if it has gluten you MUST throw it out. Yes, this is difficult because we spend time and resources building up a pantry but you are making a life-style change here and you need to commit. If you're not sure if an item is gluten-free call the company. Also you really don't want to inadvertently get sick by eating a mystery food. When in doubt, throw it out or give it to a friend.  If you live with someone who cannot give up gluten make a space on a separate shelf and go-ahead label it–“My (insert name here) gluten-free shelf”!


3. For the first 2 weeks, which are the most difficult when making a major change like this, decide to prepare your own food. This may seem like a lot of work but I promise it will become easier. Sign up for our [*Get Picky* news letter](http://getpicky.co/recipes/) to receive a meal planning guide which includes a weekly shopping list and some simple recipes to kick-start your change. We will also include some easy brown-bag work lunches.


4. As you make this transition, you may find that hunger creeps up more quickly in between meal times. It’s important to have balanced, healthy, whole meals to avoid this. There are a lot of great snack ideas that we’ve compiled into our [recipe index](http://getpicky.co/recipes/).


5. Keep a food journal and record how you feel over the 2 weeks. Are you seeing any changes in your energy level, your skin, your digestion? As you take on more adventurous recipes, add ingredients one at a time and closely monitor how you react to each item. From my experience, many of the GF packaged foods have Tapioca flour and various gums which makes my stomach cranky.


6. When you’re invited over to a friends for dinner, politely let them know about your gluten-free diet. Tell the host YOU will bring along a pot-luck style GF dish to share. This way you know exactly what goes into your dish. Sign up for the [*Get Picky* news letter](http://getpicky.co/recipes/) for crowd pleasing potluck style dishes to share.


7. After the 2 weeks of prepping your own food, you’re likely itching to go out. Where to go? The best way to find gluten-free restaurants is to first search on [Yelp](http://www.yelp.com/) or [Find Me Gluten Free](http://www.findmeglutenfree.com/). Even if a restaurant doesn’t have “gluten-free” in the description, I’ll do a search on the restaurant page for “gluten” to see what people have to say or if any dishes pop up. It takes some effort but it’s worth while. When I find a good spot, I’ll add it to my growing list–check out the [GF food map](http://getpicky.co/map/) for Los Angeles/California. Before going out, give the restaurant a call during non-busy hours and ask to speak to the manager. Tell them how excited you are to dine at their restaurant and you're interested to know what options you have. They may have to talk with the chef after you briefly describe your food restriction.


8. Make a dining card. I have a pack of dining cards in pretty much every language. These are great (but have also gotten me kicked out of my favorite thai restaurant). Celiac Travel created a [set of cards](http://www.celiactravel.com/cards/) in many languages that you can print out and keep this in your wallet for dining.


I wish you the best of luck with this transition. It can be tough at times, but stick with it and I think you’ll find numerous wonderful benefits. We will continually bring you delicious gluten free recipes, restaurants and ideas to live a healthy, full life.

P.S. As always, talk to your doctor about making changes to your diet/lifestyle. I’ve compiled this list from my own personal experiences and what works perfectly for me might be another story for you. That said, I’m open to chat—head over to my contact page.
