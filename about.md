As a kid, I got labeled _Picky!_ by refusing to eat common dishes like pasta, sandwiches, and pizza because they all made me feel ugh, sick! 


While I was a student at UCLA, I became very ill. I lost a ton of weight and was constantly sick. The many doctors I saw had no answers for my low white blood cell count, my iron deficiency, my lack of energy and many other persistent health issues. 


Years later I hear about an auto-immune disorder called Celiac disease. After a blood test and biopsy it became clear that I did in fact have Celiac disease. After this diagnosis I started the only known course of treatment, a strict, life-long gluten-freediet. At that time, being gluten-free was rather obscure so I would have to get picky about everything I ate. 


Now gluten-free diets have become a bit of a fad where I live. Most of the time when I dine out, waiters and restaurant staff are usually accommodating but there are times when I get the eye-roll or even asked to leave! Again, I’m labeled picky. 


So it seems I still can't escape my "picky" label. But hey, maybe being picky is a good thing because it has enabled me to regain my strength and get back on track to a healthy life. For me, being picky is about about listening to my body and knowing what I need to thrive. 


I'm not the only one who's picky for a good reason. People live with all kinds of dietary restrictions: gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, nut allergies, dairy free and so on. I believe there's a real need for tools that help people find things they can eat safely. I created this site to keep track of restaurants (check out the [GF Map](http://picky.tips/map/)) and [recipes](http://picky.tips/recipes/) in the hope that it's useful to others who are similarly picky. Please send me a note if you have ideas for recipes or would like to collaborate. 


Thanks for stopping by!
