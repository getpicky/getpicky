<p>When I was a youngster I got the label: <b>Picky!</b> Refusing to eat common kid-friendly dishes like pasta, sandwiches, and pizza because they made me feel icky.

<p>While attending University, I became very ill. I lost weight, started losing my hair and was always sick with a cold. I was a shell of my former self and the many doctors I’d seen had no answers. I had to take health into my own hands. I started experimenting with various diets and cleanses in order to get back on track and feel like myself again. 

<p>Another 5 years goes by and I hear about this auto-immune disorder called Celiac. I visit a few reputable sites that describe the symptoms. Do I have this? After a blood test and a biopsy it’s very clear that I have Celiac. Immediately I start the only prescribed treatment, a life-long strict Gluten Free diet. This was going to be difficult and I’d have to get Picky! 

<p>Gluten has become a bit of a fad where I live. Most of the time when I dine out, waiters and kitchen staff are accommodating to my needs but there is the rare and embarrassing occasion when I get the eye-roll or even asked to leave! Again, I’m labeled Picky. But hey, maybe being Picky is a good thing! Being Picky has enabled me to regain my strength and get back on track to a healthy life. Being Picky is about listening to your body and knowing what you need. 

<p>I realized there was a need for a product that would help people with dietary restrictions—Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian, Nut Allergies, Dairy Free and so on. I’m using this platform to document my process for finding restaurants in the Los Angeles area that cater to Gluten Free eaters. I’ll also post yummy recipes and ideas for living a healthy full life. 

<p>Thanks for stopping by!
