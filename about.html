<p>When I was a youngster I got the label: <b>Picky!</b> Refusing to eat common kid-friendly dishes like pasta, sandwiches, and pizza because they made me feel ugh, sick! 

<p>During my undergrad years at UCLA, I became very ill. I lost a ton of weight and was constantly sick with a cold. The many doctors I saw had no answers for my low white blood cell count, my iron deficiency, my lack of energy and many other persistent health issues. 

<p>Another 5 years goes by and I start hearing about this auto-immune disorder called Celiac. I visited yet another perplexed doctor who gave me a blood test and biopsy to conclude that I did indeed have Celiac. Immediately I started the only prescribed treatment, a life-long strict Gluten Free diet. At that time, being Gluten Free was a bit obscure and peculiar, so I knew I’d have to get really Picky about my food! 

<p>Gluten Free has become a bit of a fad where I live. Most of the time when I dine out, waiters and kitchen staff are accommodating but there is the rare and embarrassing occasion when I get the eye-roll or even asked to leave! Again, I’m labeled Picky. 

<p>But hey, maybe being Picky is a good thing! Being Picky has enabled me to regain my strength and get back on track to a healthy life. Being Picky is about listening to your body and knowing what you need to thrive. 

<p>I realized there was a need for a product that would help people with all dietary restrictions—Gluten Free, Vegan, Vegetarian, Nut Allergies, Dairy Free and so on. I’m using this platform to document my process for finding restaurants in the Los Angeles area that cater to Gluten Free eaters (check out the GF Map). I’ll also post yummy recipes and ideas for living a healthy full life. Please send me a note if you have ideas for recipes or would like to collaborate. 

<p>Thanks for stopping by!
