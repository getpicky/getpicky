There's a super secret ingredient in these brownies: black beans! These rich chocolate "flour-less" brownies are high in protein and completely gluten-free thanks to the powerhouse main ingredient.  I adapted* a whole foods recipe and added a ripe banana to cut down on sugar and used coconut oil + almond meal because it was handy.

### Dark Chocolate Brownie

#### Ingredients

 - 1 (15-ounce) can no-salt-added black beans (drained and rinsed)
 - 3 large eggs
 - 1/3 cup coconut oil *
 - 1 ripe banana *
 - 1/2 cup almond meal *
 - 1/4 cup cocoa powder
 - 1/8 teaspoon teaspoon salt
 - 2 teaspoons gluten-free pure vanilla extract
 - 1/2 cup brown sugar *
 - 1/2 cup mini semi-sweet chocolate chips *


#### Directions

 Place black beans, eggs, coconut oil, banana, cocoa powder, salt, vanilla, flour and sugar in your food processor and blend until smooth. Remove the blade and gently stir in the chocolate chips. Transfer mixture to the prepared pan. Bake 30 to 35 minutes, or until just set in the center.
