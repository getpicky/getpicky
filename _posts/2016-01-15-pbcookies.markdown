I'm always looking for good snacks to take with me on adventures (cycling especially). The bars I take usually have way too much sugar or are highly processed, not to mention super $$ these days. I came up with a recipe for a hearty healthy gluten free cookie that would stick with me on long bike rides. They are super easy too! Whip up a batch while you prep your gear for the adventure.

### Salted Peanut Butter Oat Cookies

 **Ingredients**

 - 1/3 cup coconut flour 
 - 1/3 cup sweet white rice flour (mochi) 
 - 2/3 cup quick cooking gluten free oats  
 - 1/4 tsp stevia 
 - 1 tsp baking powder 
 - pinch of table salt 
 - 1 tsp pumpkin pie spice 
 - 1/3 cup coconut sugar 
 - 2 Tbs smooth peanut butter  
 - 3 Tbs agave 
 - 1/4 cup almond milk 
 - 2 eggs 
 - 1 tsp vanilla 
 - flake salt for top of cookie 
 - dry roasted peanuts

 **Directions**
 
 In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients together (flours, oats, stevia, sugar, baking powder, table salt & spices). In a smaller bowl mix wet ingredients (peanut butter, eggs, agave, almond milk, vanilla). Add wet ingredients to dry mixture. If dough is too dry add a smidge more almond milk. Scoop golf ball sized dough onto foil lined cookie sheet. Press with fork and add peanuts and salt on top. Cook at 350ยบ for about 25 mins.
