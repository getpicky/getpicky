Even though Pad Thai is made with rice noodles it's usually not guaranteed to be 100% gluten free. Here I attempt to recreate my favorite dish using ingredients from our local market. The base of the dish is Shirataki noodles (instead of the traditional rice noodles) which are a translucent Japanese noodle made from the konjac yam. These noodles absorb a ton of flavor and have zero net carbohydrates, no calories, and no gluten.
