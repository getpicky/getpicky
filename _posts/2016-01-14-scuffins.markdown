A hybrid between a scone and a muffinâ€”a scuffin? The result of my latest baking experiment was unexpectedly tasty but my muffins had more of a scone texture!! Perhaps for the next post, I'll make a glutenfree scone deliberately. ðŸ˜€

### Blueberry Scuffin Recipe

 **Ingredients**

 - 1 cup rice flour 
 - 1 cup coconut flour 
 - 1/2 tsp baking soda 
 - 1/4 tsp salt 
 - 1/4 tsp stevia 
 - 1 tbs psyllium 
 - 2 eggs 
 - 1/4 cup of agave (approx) 
 - 1 cup sweetened vanilla almond milk 
 - 1 tsp vanilla extract 
 - 1 Tbs apple cider vinegar 
 - 1 cup blueberries (frozen) 
 - 1/4 cup coconut oil 

 **Directions**
 
 Mix dry and wet ingredients separately and then mix together. fold in the frozen blueberries. spoon into paper cups. bake at 300Âº for 45 minutes (give or take) cooking times may vary because the #psyllium absorbs lots of moisture and takes a while to cook through. lower temps for longer helps, but keep a close eye on them.
